<para>
  Due: &survey-due;
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Summary:</emphasis>  In this assignment, you
  will gather information about the structure of the course, discuss
  the course with me, and enter some background information for a 
  College survey.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Purposes:</emphasis>  To encourage you to
  learn about the structure of the course and the course web.  To give
  me a bit more information about you.  
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Expected Time:</emphasis> One to two hours for 
  parts one, two, and three.  Additional time for the readings in part
  four: About one hour.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Collaboration:</emphasis>  Each student should 
  turn in his or her own responses to this assignment.  However, you may
  certainly work with other students as you review the course materials
  and answer the questions.  You may discuss the assignment with anyone
  you wish.  You may obtain help from anyone you wish, but you should
  clearly document that help.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Citation:</emphasis>  Since this assignment
  explicitly asks you to read and summarize pages on the course web,
  you need not cite such pages.  However, if you rely on pages from
  outside the course web for information, you should cite those pages.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Submitting:</emphasis> Email your answers to
  part one to <email>rebelsky@grinnell.edu</email>, using a subject
  of <quote>CSC 207 Course Details (<emphasis>*Your Name*</emphasis>)</quote>
  For example, if I were to submit answers to the first set of
  questions, it would be titled <quote>CSC 207 Course Details (Samuel
  A. Rebelsky)</quote>.
</para>

<para>
  You do not need to submit anything for parts two, three, and four.
  You do, however, need to meet with me as part of your work for part two.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Warning:</emphasis> So that this assignment
  is a learning experience for everyone, I may spend class time publicly
  critiquing your work.
</para>

<section id="the-course"><title>Part One: The Course</title>

<para>
  As you might have been able to tell from the first day of class,
  I have a wide variety of opinions about learning and teaching in CS
  which are reflected in how I run the class.  You can (and should)
  learn more about these perspectives from the course web.  In this
  portion of the assignment, you will review the course web and answer
  some basic questions.

<section id="the-student"><title>Part Two: About You</title>

<para>
  As I start a new course, I like to learn a little bit about each
  student in the course.  I find that knowing more about my students
  helps me teach better.  In addition, students from other semesters have said
  (approximately) <quote>Sam, you should find a way to get students in this
  course to meet with you early in the semester.</quote>  Hence, I
  require each student in this course to sign up for a fifteen minute meeting 
  with me some time during the first week of class.  You will find a 
  sign-up sheet outside my office.
</para>

<para>
  Here are some of the things we might discuss in that meeting.
</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    What is your major (or intended major)?  And yes, it's okay to say
