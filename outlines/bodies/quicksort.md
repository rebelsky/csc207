Quicksort
---------

* Divide and conquer
* Using smaller/larger as the division strategy
* Randomness helps us select an approximation of the median
    * I'm bad at probabilistic analysis, so we won't do it

Lab
---

* In the lab, you'll implement the partition portion of Quicksort over
  arrays.

Key Ideas
---------

* What are key ideas from the design of Quicksort that you might apply 
  as you design other algorithms?
