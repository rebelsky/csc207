Textual Input and Output
------------------------

* For many years, the only way you interacted with the computer was from
  the command line.
* These days, we more frequently interact via more complicated GUIs.
* But it's still nice to be able to generate and read text (not least
  because we'll want to store data in files and retrieve data from
  those files).

Output
------

* We'll explore output by looking at the Java API for some basic output
  classes.  (In part, we're doing it this way because you need to get
  used to reading the API.)
* The classes we'll consider are
    * `java.io.PrintWriter`
    * `java.io.File`
