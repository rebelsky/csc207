Leftover Stuff on Basic Types
-----------------------------

* I'll do a quick review.
* Do you have questions from the readings?
* Make sure to browse the API so that you can see what functions are
  available.

Textual Input and Output
------------------------

* For many years, the only way you interacted with the computer was from
  the command line.
* These days, we more frequently interact via more complicated GUIs.
* But it's still nice to be able to generate and read text (not least
  because we'll want to store data in files and retrieve data from
  those files).

Output
------

* We'll explore output by looking at the Java API for some basic output
  classes.  (In part, we're doing it this way because you need to get
  used to reading the API.)
* The classes we'll consider are
    * `java.io.PrintWriter`
    * `java.io.File`

Input
-----

* We'll explore input by looking at the Java API for some basic input
  classes.  (In part, we're doing it this way because you need to get
  used to reading the API.)
* The classes we'll consider are
    * `java.io.InputStreamReader`
    * `java.io.BufferedReader`
    * `java.io.FileReader`

Lab
---

* There should be a bit of time to start [the lab](../labs/io.html).
