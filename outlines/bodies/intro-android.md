Why Android Apps?
-----------------

Why are we doing a bit of Android development in a class whose primary
foci are supposed to be object-oriented design and data structures and
algorithms?

* Developing applications helps you contextualize your work.  While we
  will often build toy programs, they are likely to be more real.
* As you'll quickly see, App development exercises many of the concepts
  you've been learning about object-oriented design, particularly
  inheritance and polymorphism.
* App development allows us to introduce some concepts that modern
  curricular standards suggest should be covered somewhere in the
  curriculum, such as event-driven programming, markup languages,
  and basic GUI progrmaming.
* Too often, we have you build only small programs.  Working with Apps
  let you get a taste of dealing with larger programs.

Quick notes on Android development
----------------------------------

Here are some things to keep in mind as you develop for Android.

* Android applications have many disparate pieces
    * UI elements - buttons, text areas, etc. 
    * Layouts - Govern the placement of UI elements
    * Resources - Sounds, images, even many of the strings that you
      put on the screen.
    * Code - does the real work
* There are various ways to tie things together
    * Call *this code* when *this action occurs* (event-driven programming)
    * Use *this resource* here
    * Etc.
* You'll find that you need to plan a bit better where things go and
  how things interact.

Warnings
--------

* Many interacting parts leads to many potential problems.  Things 
  won't always go as easily as they might.  (And Eclipse is involved,
  which always makes things more dangerous.)
* We will do a few quick classes to give you the flavor of development.
  After that, we are likely to provide you with apps that you modify.
    * We really don't want Android to interfere.  It's an add-on, more
      than anything.
* I'm barely a novice Android programmer.  But I have years of experience
  dealing with the complications of programming.
