Some Notes on Java
------------------

* As you've noted, it's relatively easy to call a `static` method in
  another class: you just write the name of the class, a period, and
  the method name.
    * Almost every method call will be preceded by something and a
      period.  Sometimes it's a class name (for static methods), sometimes
      it's an object name (for object methods).

Some Notes on Debuggers
-----------------------

* Amazingly, I don't have a lot to say about debuggers, other than that
  I think they're a good idea.
* Oh, I'll mention that I  prefer textual debuggers like <code>gdb</code>.
