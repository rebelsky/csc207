Some Notes on Debuggers
-----------------------

* Amazingly, I don't have a lot to say about debuggers, other than that
  I think they're a good idea, but not a silver bullet.
* Oh, I'll mention that I  prefer textual debuggers like `gdb`.
* And I don't recommend that you regularly debug byinserting print
  statements.
