Lists
-----

* A useful way to display data.
* A chance to adapt.

Lab
---

* Try to replicate the list-building portion of the reading (or something
  similar).

Debrief
-------

* Was it worth a week of your time to play with Android?
* Should we do Android at the beginning of the semester and have each
  assignment tie in an Android activity (e.g., come up with reasons you
  want to use certian data structures with the list)?
* Should we just do GUI programming on the computer instead?
