Background: Our Sorting Package
-------------------------------

Testing Sorting
---------------

* We decided in the last class that one way to test a sorting routine is
  to 
    * start with a sorted array,
    * generate every permutation of that array,
    * sort each permutation, and
    * compare each result to the original array.
* The file `TestUtils.java` contains most of those tests.

Insertion sort
--------------

* Insertion sort is a classic sorting algorithm
* Divide the array into sorted and unsorted
* Repeatedly grab the first thing from unsorted and put it in the
  right place.

Selection sort
