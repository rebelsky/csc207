Algorithm Design
----------------

* You are faced with a new algorithmic problem.  How do you approach
  solving it?
    * And what are common patterns of algorithms?
* We'll take a few minutes for you to talk amongst yourselves, and then
  we'll see what you've come up with.

ADT Design
----------

* What are Sam's three questions for ADT design?

Data Structure Design
---------------------

* What are Sam's three questions for DS design?

Object Design
-------------

* Object-oriented programmers tend to like to think about object design
  in similar ways.
* That is, what are common patterns of design.
* Here's one: The singleton.  It's a class in which we want only one
  object.
* Take a few minutes to talk to your friends about other common patterns
  of design.
* A few that we've used
    * Adapter - Convert an object to meet a different interface
    * Decorator - Extend methods in another class, but meet the same interface.
    * Delegate - Ask another object to do most of the work.
    * Factory - A way to pass around constructors.
    * Iterator - Provide access to the values in a structure without
      giving access to the internal design of the structure
    * Model-View-Controller

Program and Test Design
