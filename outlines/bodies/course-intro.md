About the Course
----------------

* CSC 207, like CSC 151 and CSC 161, is about a lot of different but
  related things.
    * It's a course about _formalized problem solving_, how you take
      a problem, formalize the problem, design a solution, express
      the solution in a formal language, and analyze the solution
      (and perhaps the problem).
    * It's a course about _algorithms_, the instructions we write
      to solve problems.
    * It's a course about _abstract data types_ and _data structures_,
      the ways in which we organize information as we solve problems.
      (Our organization can have a significant impact on our algorithms.)
    * It's a course in _programming_, the implementation of algorithms
      and data structures.
    * And it's a course in _software design_, how you approach the problem
      of designing and linking together disparate parts to make a 
      working program.
* In exploring algorithms, we will 
    * Consider a few classic algorithms.
    * Learn asymptotic analysis, a formal technique for comparing the
      running time or space usage of algorithms.
    * Develop some general patterns of algorithm design.
    * And, of course, design our own algorithms.
* In exploring abstract data types and data structures, we will
    * Consider a few classic ADTs and data structures
    * Design our own ADTs and Data structures
    * Develop a few general approaches to the design of data structures
    * Consider ways to consider the efficacy of a data structure 
      (typically in terms of the algorithm it serves)
    * And, of course, implement a variety of ADTs and data structures
* In exploring program design, we will begin your path on understanding
  object-oriented design.  We will focus on the three tiers of OOD -
    * _Encapsulation_ - techniques for grouping related parts together 
      and shielding them from the resting of the program.
    * _Inheritance_ - techniques for defining new things from old.
    * _Polymorphism_ - techniques for designing and writing things
      that work in multiple, relatedacontexts.
* And yes, you'll learn how to program in Java.
* We will also work on a variety of general skills in addition to
  problem solving - group work, thinking on your feet, communication,
  and more.

* From my perspective, CSC 207 is the real gateway to the major, the course
  in which you start to become a real computer scientist and/or a real
  programmer.
* Yes, you've written programs, algorithms, and data structures in your
  previous courses, but your depth of analysis has been relatively shallow
  and your programs have been comparatively small.
* Of course, our analysis won't be as deep as it gets in 301 or 341, and
  our programs won't be as large as they get in 323, 325, or 362, but
  we do ramp things up a bit in this course.
* _And no, we do not intend this course as a weed-out course_

The Course Themes: Computing for Social Good and Android App Development
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This semester, we are trying an experiment of adding themes to the
  course, just as we have themes in 151 and 161.
* Drawing upon surveys of prospective and past CSC 207 students, and
  with some of my input, my research students decided upon two general
  areas to include: Computing for Social Good and Android App Development.
