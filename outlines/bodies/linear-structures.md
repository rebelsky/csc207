Linear Structures
-----------------

* Simple collections.
* Two basic operations: `put` and `get`.
* Sam thinks of linear structures as a magic box.  You give the box a
  policy for returning values and it folows that policy when you get
  something.

Stacks
------

* Linear structures with a "last in, first out" policy.
* Terminology: `put` is called `push`; `get` is called `pop`.
* Can be implemented with arrays or linked structures.

Lab
---

* Read code.
* Fix code.
