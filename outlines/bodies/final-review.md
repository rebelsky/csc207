Some questions on the course
----------------------------

* What's something I did well?
* Two things I know I did poorly:
    * Did not grade enough
    * Did not have enough labs
* What else should I improve?
* What else do you want me to know about your experience in the course?

Some things you didn't learn 
-----------------------------

* Students often put "proficient in Java" on their resumes.
* But you're not.  It takes a few years of thinking in Java to be
  proficient.
* And we also don't cover the full language.
* Nor do we give you deep experience with OOP.
* So maybe you want to take some time and learn on your own

### Uncovered (or insufficiently covered) OOP

* More practice with designing objects
* More practice with inheritance
* Key design patterns, including
    * Listeners (is that a pattern)?
    * Flyweights

### Uncovered Java

* Protection levels
* Swing and other GUI toolkits (I foget what's in Java 8)
* More of the standard utilities
* More event-driven approaches

### Uncovered Misc

* Branching in git
* Rearranging commits ("rebasing") in git
* Test suites
* Other build approaches for Java

Preparing for the Final
-----------------------

* Likely to focus more on end-of-semester stuff.
* Do the practice final.
* Look at the take-home final (maybe even sketch answers).
* Make sure that you learn the details of the big data structures.
    * Hash tables.
    * Heaps.
    * Various kinds of lists, including skip lists.
    * BSTs.
* Think about questions I tend to ask (in class, on exams, etc.).
* We can look at a few problems if you'd like.
