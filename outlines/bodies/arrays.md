Some Initial Notes on HW2
-------------------------

* Many of you spent about the amount of time I would have hoped 4-5 hours.
* The biggest challenge seems to have been the lab equipment (Git and
  Eclipse).  Also learning a bit about syntax.
* A number of you said that getting the syntax right for parts C and D
  was hard.  There's a reason that I wrote "It's okay if this code doesn't
  compile."
* The average one came from a bug in Java's implementation of binary
  search, a bug that was first noticed by someone at Google.  
    * I included the problem to remind you that you really do need to
      think about boundary cases.

ADTs, Revisted
--------------

When you design an ADT, you should think about

* Philosophy
* Practica
* Procedures
* ...

One big conceptual issue: Are you a minimalist or a maximalist?
(Do you put as little or as much as possible in your design?)

After designing, think about implementation.

Arrays in Java
--------------

* Arrays are both an ADT (in the sense that we can think about them
  as meeting some abstract goals that can be implemented in many
  ways) and a data structure (in the sense that we can also pay
  attention to their implementation.
* We started to look at Arrays as ADTs on the first day of class.
* We'll continue today.

Strings in Java (optional)
