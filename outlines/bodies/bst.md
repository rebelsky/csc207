About binary search trees
-------------------------

* Linked structures.
* Two links from every node.  One to the "smaller" values, one to the
  "larger" values.
* When used to implement ditionaries, store a key/value pair in each
  node.
* Note: While association lists only require that we be able to compare
  value for equality, binary search trees require that we have a way
  to order values.
* Analysis?
