Tools for Software Development
------------------------------

* This course is partially about building software.  And so we'll look
  at the tools and other resources that good programmers use to support
  software development.
* Their are some obvious ones, some that you've probably used in your prior
  courses.
    * Editors let you create your code, and sometimes even help you
      better understand the code (e.g., by doing syntax highlighting
      or providing easy navigation features).
    * Compilers translate your source code into executable code.
    * Debuggers, like `gdb`, help you identify bugs.  
      (Print statements are not a debugger, even though they occasionally 
      have their role in tracking down errors.)
    * Style checkers see if your code "makes sense".
    * References tell you more about the libraries and such that
      you use.
    * ...
* We'll be exploring (at least) three other kinds of tools this semester.
    * Source Code Management Systems provide a way to keep a history
      of your project and to more easily collaborate with others.
    * Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the "kitchen sink"
      of software development.  They tie together lots and lots of useful
      tools,
    * Unit Testing Frameworks help you identify the existence of errors
      in your code.  (Your debugger should still help you track it down.)
* Git will be our source code management system, Eclipse our IDE, and
  JUnit our testing framework.  All three are popular in "the real world".
