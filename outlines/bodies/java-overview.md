A few more notes on Git
-----------------------

You may find it more convenient to use the following commit command,
which doesn't open the editor.

    git commit -m "*message*"

I'll admit that I prefer to open the editor and see a quick list of
the changes I'm committing.  (I also often write multi-line commit
messages.)


Some notes on Java
------------------

* Yes, you'll find that Java looks a lot like C.
* Some big differences:
    * Everything goes in a class.
    * You have to indicate protection levels.
    * You have to give `main` parameters.
    * When you're treating Java like C, you need to put `static`
      before function (method) and global (field) declarations.
    * Java is much more sensitive about types.
