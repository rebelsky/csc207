Outline 02: An Introduction to Java Development
===============================================

Held: Monday, 2 September 2013

Back to [Outline 01 - An Introduction to the Course](outline.01.html).
On to [Outline 03 - An Overview of Java](outline.03.html).

**Summary**

We begin to explore the program development tools that we will be
using in this course, and that I hope you will continue to use in
future courses.

**Overview**

* Tools for programmers.
* Lab: Eclipse.
* Lab: Git and  Eclipse.

**Administrivia**

* Today is basically a "introduction to lab equipment" class.  You'll be
  configuring and playing with Eclipse and git.
* Reminder: Even if you're not a CS major (and not planning a CS major),
  you can be on the csstudents mailing list and you can participate in
  CS Table.  Email me to get added to the mailing list.
* With over sixty surveys in between my two classes, I didn't have time 
  to respond to all of them yet.  (If I'm lucky, I can respond to a
  survey in 10 minutes.)  Give me a few days.
* I don't know if you care, but today's labs took me four hours to
  _revise_ (from what my students had written).  I may not be able to
  keep up that pace, which means that some classes will switch from lab
  to lecture and some readings will, well, just not exist.
* I should have homework 2 ready by Wednesday.
* Although the Git reading focused on command-line Git, the lab will
  focus on using Git with Eclipse.  
  (Just a heads up (or is that "head's up"?))
* If you have time, please fill out the [evaluation form for today's
  labs and reading](http://bit.ly/csc207-2013F-eval-git).
* There's another introductory survey I'd like you to fill out.  
  It's available at [http://bit.ly/risc-pretest](http://bit.ly/risc-pretest).
  Please fill it out by Wednesday.
* We're experimenting with the use of Clickers in CSC 151.  We may also
  use them in this class.  (I'm hoping to have some Clicker questions
  set up for today.)

Tools for Software Development
------------------------------

* This course is partially about building software.  And so we'll look
  at the tools and other resources that good programmers use to support
  software development.
* Their are some obvious ones, some that you've probably used in your prior
  courses.
    * Editors let you create your code, and sometimes even help you
      better understand the code (e.g., by doing syntax highlighting
      or providing easy navigation features).
    * Compilers translate your source code into executable code.
    * Debuggers, like `gdb`, help you identify bugs.  
      (Print statements are not a debugger, even though they occasionally 
      have their role in tracking down errors.)
    * Style checkers see if your code "makes sense".
    * References tell you more about the libraries and such that
      you use.
    * ...
* We'll be exploring (at least) three other kinds of tools this semester.
    * Source Code Management Systems provide a way to keep a history
      of your project and to more easily collaborate with others.
    * Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the "kitchen sink"
      of software development.  They tie together lots and lots of useful
      tools,
    * Unit Testing Frameworks help you identify the existence of errors
      in your code.  (Your debugger should still help you track it down.)
* Git will be our source code management system, Eclipse our IDE, and
  JUnit our testing framework.  All three are popular in "the real world".
