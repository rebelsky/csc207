* Today's writeup: Exercise 4.
* Welcome to today's prospective.
* I will reserve time at the start of class for questions on the exam.
* Reading for Tuesday: [Queues](../readings/queues.html)
* I am returning the makeups for exam 1.
    * 4 of you increased your grade
    * 8 of you had no change.  Many of your average functions still had
      bugs, many of your replacement functions were still O(n^2).
* Review session Tuesday night (I think)
* CS study break tonight (I think)
* Consider running for the SEPC
* Get ready to vote on T-Shirts (the Curried Lamb-Duh T-shirt is clearly
  the best)
* Extra credit:
    * Convocation, Wednesday, noon: Elizabeth Colbert (the Sixth Extinction?)
    * CS extras Thursday: ???
    * CS table Friday: TBD
