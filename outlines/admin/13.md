* Readings for Tuesday: Interfaces, Polymorphism, Weiss 4
    * Weiss 4 lasts the whole week, you need not do the whole thing.
* Reminder: Lab writeups get sent to me, and not the grader.
* No writeup today!
* You should have received grades on HW2 along with an anonymous detailed
  grade sheet.
* I'll reserve a few minutes for questions on the homework.
* Now that I've graded writeup 8, we should talk for a few minutes 
  about Exceptions.
* Extra credit: 
    * CS Extra Thursday at 4:30: Stone on Red/Black Trees
    * CS Table Friday at noon: Law, Order, and Computers
    * More?
