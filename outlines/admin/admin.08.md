* Reminder: Mentor session TONIGHT at 8pm (or maybe 8:30)
* Although there are links (broken?) to labs for yesterday and today,
  we won't be holding those labs.  (Parts of the labs are in the homework
  assignment.)  I do hope to hold lab on Friday.
* Nationwide will be on campus next Tuesday to talk about (and recruit for)
  jobs and internships.  There's a 4:15 talk, but there's also a noon lunch
  for Math/Stats and CS majors.  Signs should be around.
* Reading for Friday (expect it Thursday; I'll send email)
     * [Input and Output](../readings/io.html)
* It's been noted that the kinds of questions I'm asking on your homework
  assignment are a lot like coding questions that get asked in interviews.
  The overlap is *not* intentional.  (I don't object to it, but I just
  choose questions that I think will challenge you appropriately.)
* If you are not on the CS mailing list and want to be on it, let me 
  know and I'll get you added.
* I see only one (worried) prologue for HW3.  
    * Here's a hint on the last problem: Recursion is likely to be your 
      friend, at least at first.
* EC opportunities:
    * Humanities Center Speaker Sarah Hendron, TONIGHT, 7:30 p.m., JRC101
      Waking the Machines: Art, Design, and Adaptive Technology
    * Learning from Alumni 2:15-4:05 Thursday: Ian Lunderskov '08
    * We think the Matt Atherton Thursday extra is NOT happening.  Sorry.
    * CS Table, Friday: Trusting Trust.
    * More?
