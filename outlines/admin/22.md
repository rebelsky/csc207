* MathLAN may or may not be acting up again.  Yesterday morning was
  backups left over from the weekend.  I'm not sure what last night was,
  or what today will bring.
* No reading for Wednesday.
* Homework 5 is due *next* Wednesday (March 5), but you may need two
  weeks to get it done.
* The exam makeup is due Sunday at 10:30 p.m.  There will be no extensions.
* I took off 1/4 point for incorrect tarballs.  A few of you talked to me
  about it and I accept that for the first exam, a bit of carelessness
  or confusion is possible.  I will restore those points if you show me
  that I took them off.
* Review session tonight at some time.
* Extra credit: 
    * Town hall meeting Today at noon or 7pm.
    * Wellness fair, around the JRC, 5:30-8:00 pm
    * CS Extras, Thursday at 4:30 p.m.: The new CS Curriculum.
    * More?
