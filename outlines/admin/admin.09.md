* Reading for Monday (it's ready!)
    * [Exceptions](../readings/exceptions.html)
* I've prepared a lab for today, but I don't know if there will be time.
* I hear that some of you are losing files.  You should make it a practice
  to save early and often.  You should also make it a practice to commit
  regularly.  (Say, after each working procedure you write.)
* I'm in the midst of grading HW2.  I should have it done by Monday. 
  We'll discuss the averaging problem.
* Only about half the class has filled out the prologue (as of
  8:30 p.m. on Thursday)
    * Do you want hints on the strategy?
    * Your initial solution will be inefficient.  That's okay.
      (And yes, it can stay inefficient.)
    * Hint number one: An exhaustive approach is a reasonable start.
* EC opportunities:
    * CS Table, Friday: Trusting Trust.
    * CS Table, next Friday: Pair Programming.
    * More?
