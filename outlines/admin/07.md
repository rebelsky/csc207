* Sorry about the limited amount of lab time yesterday; I was assuming that we 
  could go through the questions a bit more quickly.  Today we'll just do lab,
  so there should be enough time (perhaps even enough to work more on the
  arrays lab).
    * There's a lot on the outline for today, but I don't think it's worth
      going over.  We did some yesterday, and lab time is important.
    * In the near future, we'll debrief on relative time spent on different 
      approaches.
* I'll hold a review session at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
* [New homework assignment](../assignments/assignment.03.html).  No partners!
    * Earnest says "This is a key homework, and you'll learn more by doing it
      on your own."
* Today's writeup: Exercise 9
    * Due Friday
    * Subject: CSC 207 Writeup 5: Basic Types (YOUR NAME(S))
* Extra credit: 
    * CS Extras, Thursday: Ushahidi, Android, and 207 by Spencer, Daniel, and Lea.
    * CS Table Friday: The ACM Code of Ethics.
    * Convo Feb. 5.  (I'll give my "Why go to convo" lecture closer to the date.)
