* Study break tonight at 8pm in the CS commons.
* I've changed my grading strategy a bit, to "Excellent, Very Good,
  Good, Fair, Poor" (it's more or less the same as the old check
  system, but with new words).  Updates to the handouts will follow.
* I *think* I've responded to all of the writeups I've received.
* For second years: Special extra credit for attending the lunch session
  you were invited to.
* No lab today!  We'll do some small group and large group design.
* Does anyone need a partner for the assignment?
* Extra credit: 
    * CS Extras, Thursday: Ushahidi, Android, and 207 by Spencer, Daniel, and Lea.
    * CS Table Friday: The ACM Code of Ethics.
    * Convo Feb. 5.  (I'll give my "Why go to convo" lecture closer to the date.)
