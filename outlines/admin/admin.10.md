* **On the importance of Scholars Convocation.**
  I went to a school that had a large common core.  It was almost guaranteed
  that you or your roommate had read Freud, Plato, Kuhn, and Adam Smith.
  And that shared knowledge meant that discussions of any topic could
  draw upon those ideas.  As much as I love the open curriculum (or
  whatever term they have for it this week), I regret that Grinnell
  students have no shared knowledge base (other than what you get from
  Tutorial, and Tutorials vary significantly).  I think we'd have a higher
  level of academic discussion if everyone went to every convocation, and
  so encourage ever student to do so.

* Exception handling is one of the first places where my students start
  saying "Java is your nanny."  Can you tell why?
* I'll reserve time in class today for questions on HW3.
* I expect to have the next homework available for tomorrow.
* Readings for Tuesday:
  [Writing Your Own Classes](../readings/classes.html) and
  [Standard Object Methods](../readings/standard-methods.html).
* EC Opportunities
