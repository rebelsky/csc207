### Upcoming Work

* Reading for Monday: No reading.  We're doing another "develop in class"
  exercise.
* Today's writeup: Exercises 5c and 6d.
* Part 2 of the project is due Wednesday.

### Admin

* I distributed a partial solution to part one of the project.  (Thanks
  to GB for corrections.)
* We are continuing the lab on hash tables.
* We should look at some issues from the writeup.
    * Don't compare objects with `==` and `!=`.
    * Make sure that your loops terminate.
    * If you have to put in print statements, use `System.err.println`
      and not `System.out.println`.
    * Generally try to write loops that exit in one place.  (But there
      is clearly a balancing act between good structure and readability.)
