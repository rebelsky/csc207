* Today is basically a "introduction to lab equipment" class.  You'll be
  configuring and playing with Eclipse and git.
* Reminder: Even if you're not a CS major (and not planning a CS major),
  you can be on the csstudents mailing list and you can participate in
  CS Table.  Email me to get added to the mailing list.
* With over sixty surveys in between my two classes, I didn't have time 
  to respond to all of them yet.  (If I'm lucky, I can respond to a
  survey in 10 minutes.)  Give me a few days.
* I don't know if you care, but today's labs took me four hours to
  _revise_ (from what my students had written).  I may not be able to
  keep up that pace, which means that some classes will switch from lab
  to lecture and some readings will, well, just not exist.
* I should have homework 2 ready by Wednesday.
* Although the Git reading focused on command-line Git, the lab will
  focus on using Git with Eclipse.  
  (Just a heads up (or is that "head's up"?))
* If you have time, please fill out the [evaluation form for today's
  labs and reading](http://bit.ly/csc207-2013F-eval-git).
* There's another introductory survey I'd like you to fill out.  
  It's available at [http://bit.ly/risc-pretest](http://bit.ly/risc-pretest).
  Please fill it out by Wednesday.
* We're experimenting with the use of Clickers in CSC 151.  We may also
  use them in this class.  (I'm hoping to have some Clicker questions
  set up for today.)
