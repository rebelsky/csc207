* Welcome to our prospective
* I've reviewed about half of your projects before running out of time.  
  We'll talk about some common (and not so common) issues for about 
  ten minutes.
* Given the problems with MathLAN, I'm not sure what to do about 
  the due date of the project.  What do you think?
    * Those of you trying to fix the problem using Wireshark or whatever
      probably need to stop.
* I need two graders for next semester who can do detailed comments.
  Yes, I will provide training.
