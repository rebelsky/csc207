* I was generally quite impressed by your presentations yesterday.  
  Thanks for your hard work.  I'll need to find a way to allow demos next year.
* [Exam 3](../assignments/exam.03.html) discussed.
* Our in-class final is scheduled for 2pm Tuesday, 13 May 2014.
    * You may also take it at 2pm on Thursday, 15 May 2014.
    * There will be a take-home alternate available, due 5pm on Thursday,
      15 May 2014.
    * I will do my best to distribute both on Wednesday, 7 May 2014.
* This week will be work on Android.  No writeups necessary.  Next week
  is mostly review.
    * We have about eight Android devices, so groups of three are probably
      necessary.
    * Neither Earnest nor Sam are Android experts, so we may not be able
      to help you with everything.
