* [Notes from yesterday's review session](../eboards/extra.02.html) are now
  posted.  We had some fun exploring ArrayLists and Vectors.
* 
* There more I use it, the more I'm finding that using a modified GNU 
  style for Java programs is not ideal.  
    * I'll be working on a new style that I'll distribute on Monday.
    * For now, you may not see spaces before open parens and the method 
      name will be on the same line as all of the modifiers.
* Yesterday's talk reminded me that there's a lot of work to do to get
  the Ushahidi Java API running again.  Further investigation suggested
  that there are now multiple Web APIs, not all of which are supported
  on all sites.  We'll see how it goes.
* A few notes from HW 2
    * Why do I ask you the average question?  Because there's a great story 
      about binary search in Java.
