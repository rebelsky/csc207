* No writeup today (particularly since there's no lab today)!
* HW 6 remains due Wednesday night.
* Today is probably not the best day to have prospectives.  Oh well.  
  We'll still make them introduce themselves.
* While I've finished grading your examinations, I need to revisit some
  issues.  I hope to return them tomorrow.
    * I am nonetheless distributing [the makeup](../assignments/makeup.02.html).      Since some of you failed unit tests, you can assume you'll need to 
      do a makeup.
    * You can also read my [notes](../assignments/notes-exam02.html) on 
      the exam.
