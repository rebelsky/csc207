* A final reminder to register for the 2nd-year retreat.  It looks like
  a good opportunity to do lots of things - talk more about group work,
  learn from alums, think about choosing a major, etc.
* It sounds like there was some demand that I focus on the syntax and
  semantics of imperative Java, so I've rearranged the syllabus (including
  today) to go over it.
     * Rearranging stuff put me even further behind!  Readings may not
       be ready in time, and class sessions will probably focus on
       lecture + discussion + recitation.
* Reminder: Mentor session Wednesday night at 8pm
* Readings for Wednesday (expect them later today):
     * [Strings in Java](../readings/strings.html)
     * [Numbers in Java](../readings/numbers.html)
* Homework 3 is ready!
* EC opportunities:
    * Humanities Center Speaker Sarah Hendron, Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., JRC101
      Waking the Machines: Art, Design, and Adaptive Technology
    * Learning from Alumni 2:15-4:05 Thursday: Ian Lunderskov '08
