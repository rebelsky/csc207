* Welcome to CSC 207.  I look forward to helping you learn.
* Please call me Sam.
* Since this is a new course, I had lots of work to do on the cousre web.  
  The web is incomplete.  Sorry.
* I don't believe in going over class policies on the first day.  Please
  read the course web and ask me questions via irc, email, or in the next
  class.
