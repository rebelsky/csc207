* A friendly reminder that "Learning from Alumni" is a great opportunity
  to get real-world recommendations on how to prepare for a job or
  internship (and to network).  And you get 1 credit.  Thursdays, 2:15-4:05.
* Readings for Tuesday: 
  [Making Your Own Classes](../readings/classes.html) and
  [Standard Object Methods](../readings/standard-methods.html).
* EC opportunities:
    * Humanties Center Speaker Sarah Hendron, Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., JRC101

Some Notes on Java
------------------

* As you've noted, it's relatively easy to call a `static` method in
  another class: you just write the name of the class, a period, and
  the method name.
    * Almost every method call will be preceded by something and a
      period.  Sometimes it's a class name (for static methods), sometimes
      it's an object name (for object methods).

Some Notes on Debuggers
-----------------------

* Amazingly, I don't have a lot to say about debuggers, other than that
  I think they're a good idea.
* Oh, I'll mention that I  prefer textual debuggers like <code>gdb</code>.
