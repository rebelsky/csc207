Outline 03: An Overview of Java
===============================

Held: Tuesday, 3 September 2013

Back to [Outline 02 - An Introduction to Java Development](outline.02.html).
On to [Outline 04 - Git, Revisited](outline.04.html).

**Summary**

We begin our real exploration of Java by reading and correcting some code.

* Reflection.

**Administrivia**

* Partner assignments are up.  For the first few days, I'm using a simple
  algorithm for partner assignment.  (Can you tell what it is?)
* No Clicker Questions today.
* I think today will be the last day that I take attendance.  Afterwards,
  I'll start wandering around the room and trying to remember everyone's
  name.
* Reading 1 for tomorrow: [Simple Java for C Programmers](../readings/simple-java-c.html)
* Reading 2 for tomorrow: [Unit Testing and JUnit](../readings/unit-testing.html).  (Warning - I'm in the process of rewriting this reading.)
* CS Table this Friday: Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".
  Let me know if you want a copy.
* Any EC opportunities?
