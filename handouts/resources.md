Student-Curated Resources
=========================

While the Web site for the course contains a wide variety of resources
for learning material, including readings, labs, and some reference 
material, many students identify other materials that can help them and
their peers.  This page serves as a page to gather those resources.

I encourage you to submit resources for this page.  If you submit a
resource that I deem worth sharing, you will earn a unit of extra credit
(up to some limit to be determined).  To submit a resource, email me
a link to the resource, a potential category for the resource (e.g.,
"ADTs: Linked Lists") and a few sentences that explain why you consider
the resource useful.  If I accept the submission, I will post the link,
your text, and your initials.
