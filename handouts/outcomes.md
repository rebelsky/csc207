Learning Outcomes
=================

*(Still a work in progress.)*

This document describes the learning outcomes I expect for this course.

## Object-Oriented Design

I expect that at the end of the semester, you will have mastered the
basics of object-oriented design.  In particular, I expect that you will 
be able to

* describe and use the three pillars of object-oriented
  design: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; and
* identify and use a variety of basic design patterns, including
  Model-View-Controller, Factory, Iterator, Singleton, Adapter,
  and Decorator.
* identify objects that will contribute to a program or solution,
  design those objects, and implement those objects.

## Design and Analysis of Algorithms

I expect that at the end of the semester, you will have significantly
extended your skills in the design, implementation, and analysis of
algorithms.  In particular, I expect that you will be able to

* describe and implement classic algorithms, including
  binary search, sequential search, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, 
  Quicksort, and merge sort;
* design new algorithms* using a variety of approaches
  including greed, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming;
* analyze the running time efficiency of algorithms
  using big-O notation; and
* use loop invariants* to better design and verify
  iterative algorithms.

## Design and Analysis of Abstract Data Types and Data Structures 

I expect that at the end of the semester, you will have significantly
extended your skills in the design, implementation, and analysis of
abstract data types and algorithms.  In particular, I expect that you
will be able to

* describe and distinguish between the terms "abstract data type" and 
  "data structure";
* describe and implement classic ADTs and data
  structures, including expandable arrays, lists, stacks, queues, 
  dictionaries/maps, hash tables, binary search trees, and trees;
* design new ADTs using the PUM (philosophy, uses, methods) approach; and
* design new data structures using the LIA (layout,
  implement, analyze) approach.

## Software Construction

I expect that at the end of the semester, you will be a competent 
beginning software developer.  In particular, in addition to having
the skills described above, I expect that you will be able to

* design, implement, and run unit tests;
* develop software using an integrated development
  environment (in our case, Eclipse).
* collaborate on and keep track of the development history of code using 
  a version control system* (in our case, Git); 
* read, understand, and modify code that you did not write; 
* design and develop libraries for use in other programs;
* use libraries in your own programs; and
* responsibly incorporate code that you did not use into your own
  program.

## Java

I expect that at the end of the semester, you will be a competent beginning
Java programmer.  In particular, I expect that you will also be able to

* write programs using the imperative core of Java;
* signal and recover from errors using Java's exceptions;
* construct simple graphical user interfaces using JavaFX; and
* describe and use a variety of special Java
  constructs including anonymous inner classes and "lambdas".
