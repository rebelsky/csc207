A quick note about heapifying an array
--------------------------------------

In yesterday's class, one of you suggested that we could speed up the
heap up process by doing both children of a node "at once".  Will that
work for the following heap?

    { 3, 1, 2, 7, 8 }

Lab

An opportunity to explore various aspects of heaps and heap sort.
