_Admin_

* Reading for Friday: Inheritance
* Sorry for the mixup/delay on today's readings.  I'll do my best to
  guide you through the same material.
    * (No lab.)
* EC Opportunities
    * Convocation noon, Wednesday.
    * Learning from Alumni Thursday @ 2:15 Sam Tape and company. (3821)
    * CS Extras Thursday @ 4:30: Kim Spasaro on Linguistics Programming (3821)
    * CS Table Friday (pair programming)
    * Other?

    * The registers should hold fractions

Interfaces
----------

* Goal in program design: Separate WHAT your code does from HOW your code
  achieves that goal.
    * You can change your implementation without affecting your client code
    * Your clients can't "mess up" your code.
    * You think differently about programming if you separate the two
* Example: Points in the plane
      * Get the coordinates of the point: 
         * distance from the x axis and y axis (x, y)
             * `getX()`
             * `getY()`
         * distance from the origin and angleq
             * `getAngle()`
             * `getDistance()`
* Java encourages this approach
* Interfaces provide the WHAT, not the how

        public interface Point2D {
            double getX();
            double getY();
            double getAngle();
            double getDistance();
            Point2D add(Point2D other);
            // DOT PRODUCT!
            Point2D multiply(Point2D other);
        } // interface Point2D

        public class XYPoint implements Point2D {
           ...
        }

        public class Vector2D implements Point2D {
           ...
        }

* Two magic things happen with the "implements" keywords
    * Java forces you to implement all of the methods in Point2D.
    * If someone writes code that expects a Point2D, it will work with an
      XYPoint

Polymorphism
------------

* Polymorphism is an approach to save code / avoid repetitous code.
* Consider squaring numbers

    * Scheme

        (define square (lambda (num) (* num num)))a

    * C

        int squareInt(int x) { return x*x; }
        double squareDouble(double x) { return x*x; }

    * Java permits overloading

        int square(int x) { return x*x; }
        double square(double x) { return x*x; }

    * BUt the code is repetitious!
    * Why not code with copy-paste-change?
        * Inelegant - You can do it better by writing a single procedure (we hope)
        * What if we have to change something?
        * Code bloat

* Scheme's approach is great, but not

An example: Text blocks
-----------------------

        public interface TextBlock {
           int getWidth();
           int getHeight();
           String getRow(int i) throws Exception;
        } // interface TextBlock

        public class TextLine implements TextBlock {
           ...
        }

        public class VerticallyComposeTextBlock implements TextBlock {
          ...
        }

        TextBlock fiona = new TextLine("Hello");
        TextBlock john = new TextLine("Goodbye");
        TextBlock adam = new VCTB(fiona,john);
        TextBlock mark = new TextLine("Mark");
        TextBlock sunshine = new VCTB(adam, mark);
