Preliminaries

### Admin

* The course Web is in rough form.  (Sorry, it was a too-short break.)
  Expect to see it evolve over the next few days.
* Your first assignment is due Tusday night at 10:30 p.m.
* You also have readings due for tomorrow's class.  See the syllabus.
* Most of your remaining assignments are due on Wednesday evenings.
* I don't believe in going over class policies on the first day of class.
  Please read the course web and ask me questions via email or in person.
* I'm trying to set up a Google calendar for this course.  Please let me
  know what else you'd like to see on that calendar.
* Extra credit: MLK Day Talk, tonight @ 7:30 in JRC 101.
