### Questions

Reflections from your first encounters with Android development
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Android development can be frustrating
    * Weird hardware problems.
    * Hard to debug programs - Where is the error?
* There's a lot of cool stuff already built in.  Yay software reuse!
* You can build GUIs graphically or with XML.
    * And the graphical builder makes some interesting decisions that you may
      want to override.
