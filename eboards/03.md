_Admin_

* Partner assignments are up.  For the first few days, I'm using a simple
  algorithm for partner assignment.  (Can you tell what it is?)
* No Clicker Questions today.
* I think today will be the last day that I take attendance.  Afterwards,
  I'll start wandering around the room and trying to remember everyone's
  name.
* Reading 1 for tomorrow: [Basic Java for C Programmers](../readings/basic-java-c.html)
* Reading 2 for tomorrow: [Unit Testing and JUnit](../readings/unit-testing.html).  (Warning - I'm in the process of rewriting this reading.)
* CS Table this Friday: Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".
  Let me know if you want a copy.
* There are two labs today, but I don't have both of them linked well.
  Try using today's outline to get the links.
* EC Opportunities
  * CS Table, Friday: Turing on AI
Lab: Git (under Eclipse)
