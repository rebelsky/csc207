Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Yes, we'll do attendance again today.  
    * Hear Sam mangle last names
    * "Here" or "Present" is fine as a response.
* Please send me your GitHub account if you have not done so already.
* If you're not on the CS Students mailing list, you probably should be.
  Drop me a note and I'll ask our academic support assistant to add you.
* Feel free to send me email that suggests extra credit opportunities.
* Note: During office hours, I often end up helping students in 3813 and
  3815.  If you don't see me here, look for me there.
* Extra credit: Thursday extra on summer research in CS, Thursday @ 4:30
  in Noyce 3821.
* Extra credit: CS Table Friday at noon: 3D Printing.

### Homework

* Don't forget that the first assignment is due at 10:30 p.m. tonight.
* You have readings due for tomorrow's class.  See the syllabus for
  details.
* Lab writeup: Email me the conflicted code from Exercise 13 of the lab
  on Git.
    * Subject: CSC 207 Writeup 1: Git (*Your Name Here*)

### Questions

Tools for programmers
---------------------

* Syntax checkers - Editors that check your syntax
* File management - What are all my files and how do I put them together for a
  large project?
     make keeps track of the instructions
* Smart editors - Autocomplete / show options
* Integrated compiler.  Click a button and compile without switching windows.
* Debugger.
* Visual outline.
* Keep track of all my edits so that I can say "Whoops ... I had an answer to that
  three days ago and accidentally deleted it" and not be frustrated.
* Documentation!  (And easy access.)
* Amazing light shows that have the same effects as caffeine, but without the
  potential harm to your health
* Really good library code so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

This semester's tools

* Eclipse - IDE
* Git - Version control system

Lab
---

* Note to Sam: Students generally got through all of Eclipse and half way through
  Git.  That's about right.
* Note to students: GitHub is unhappy if you don't allow Javascript.
