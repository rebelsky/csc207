    * Questions on the homework.
* Thinking about memory.
* Loop invariants.
* Data structure invariants.

Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* For the asssignment, you do not need to grab the JSON from the Web.  Assume
  that it's in a string.  (In your epxeriments, you can just load that string
  from a file, or use a predefined string, or ...)
* Something fun you might like to contribute to
  <https://github.com/kyledreger/1000-nights>
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities:
    * _One Grinnell_ rally today at 4pm (unless you are taking photos).
    * Any self-care week activity.
    * Learning from Alumni Thursday: Erik Hanson (in person)
    * CS Extras Thursday: Summer opportunities in CS.
    * CS Table Friday: Beyond Efficiency.
    * Swim meet Friday and Saturday.
    * Dance Ensemble, Friday 7:30, Saturday 7:30, Sunday 1:00 
    * One Acts, Figure it out yourself

### Questions on the Homework

What simple tests?

    { }
    { "sam":"rebelsky" }
    { "samr" : { "fname":"Sam", "lname":"Rebelsky", "ryphot":0 } }

What do we return?

> Mostly dictionary-like thingys

> Also arrays of those

> You might create MyJSONObject and MyJSONArray

Thinking about memory
---------------------

Memory associated with your program has three parts

* Fixed 
    * Globals
    * Constants (e.g., char *str = "Hello";
* Stack
    * Local procedure variables
    * Procedure parameters
* Heap
    * Things created by malloc and new and the like

Sample code!

    public class Counter {
        static int operations = 0;
        int counter;
        void increment() {
            ++Counter.operations;
            ++this.counter;
        } // increment()

        void decrement() {
            ++Counter.operations;
            --this.counter;
        } // decrement()

        int get() {
            ++Counter.operations;
            return this.counter;
        } // get()
    } // class Counter

    public class CounterExpt {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Counter c1 = new Counter();
            Counter c2 = new Counter();
            Counter c3 = c1;

            c1.increment();
            c2.decrement();
            c3.increment();

            System.out.println("ops: " + Counter.operations);
            System.out.println("c1: " + c1.get());
            System.out.println("c2: " + c2.get());
            System.out.println("c3: " + c3.get());
            System.out.println("ops: " + Counter.operations);
        } // main
    } // class CounterExpt
  
Why doesn't this code do what we expect?

    // Replace a tree by its right subtree
    tree = tree.larger;
    
It doesn't work because it's pointer assignment (see whiteboard)

Is there a `*tree = *tree.larger` in Java?  NO

We also can't explicitly get the address of something.

Why do we not allow such assignments?

* Java tries to conceal memory.
* Subclassing means that in `*left = *right`, right have more fields than left.

Code

    class Foo {
        int x;
    }
    class Bar extends Foo {
        int y;
    }
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    Foo bar = new Bar();
    *foo = *bar;        // What does this really mean?

Loop invariants
---------------

* Evidence suggests that programmers frequently write incorrect code.  
* Retrospective: Test!
* Maybe we'd be better off finding techniques to write correct code in the
  first place.
* Basically: Think carefully about the code while you are writing it
    * Perhaps even construct an informal proof that it's correct
* Evidence; Loops create many problems - Incorrect termination conditions,
  off-by-1 errors, etc.
* Enter loop invariants - A way to think carefully about what the procedure
  does.
     * What is the state of my program (memory) before the loop starts?
     * What is the state of my program after some number of repetitions?
     * What is the state of my program after the loop terminates?

Data structure invariants
