### Questions

Orders for traversing trees
---------------------------

* Lots of choices
* Depth-first vs. breadth first
* Left-to-right vs. right to left
* Prefix vs postfix vs infix
* If we print a BST left-to-right, depth-first, infix, in what order do
  we see the values? - Smallest to largest
