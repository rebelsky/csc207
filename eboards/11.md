_Admin_

* Note: I seem to be pushing you harder than I'd like on the assignments.
    * Please don't spend much more than six hours on an assignment.  If
      you're spending more than that, something is going seriously wrong.
    * We'll do a demo of how not to approach these assignments.
* Note: I feel like a Grinnell student.  I seem to have more work than I
  can physically do.
    * HW4 is in rough shape.  We'll discuss it in the last ten minutes
      of class.
    * I also expect to have the reading available late today.
* Reading for Wednesday: Inheritance
* SACNAS Ice Cream Social: Thursday, September 19th at 8:00PM in the 
  Biology Commons
* EC Opportunities
    * Convocation noon, Wednesday.
    * Learning from Alumni Thursday @ 2:15 Sam Tape and company.
    * CS Extras Thursday @ 4:30: Kim Spasaro on Linguistics Programming
    * CS Table Friday (pair programming)
    * Other?

A brief introduction to objects
-------------------------------

* Core of OOP: Objects
    * Group related things together
        * Data
        * Methods
    * Protect from outside world
* In Java, we describe objects with template classes
    * Data are in fields - looks like a variable, but associated with individual
      objects.

    public class Counter {
        int value;
    }
    
    * Methods are methods.  
    * Constructors look like methods, but with a specified name and no
      return type

    public class Counter {
        int value;
        int increment;

        /** 
         * Create a new counter with teh value zero.
         */
        public Counter() {
            this.value = 0;
            this.increment = 1;
        } // Counter()

        /**
         * Create a counter initialed to value.
         */
        public Counter(int value) {
            this.value = value;
            this.increment = 1;
        } // Counter(int)
    } // class Counter

A few tricks
------------

* Sometimes you have the wrong type of object, you can cast objects.
     * Throws ClassCastException
* Can also ask
      thing instanceof Class

Standard object methods
-----------------------

* You are expecgted to provide some methods.  (They will be available for every
  object, whether or not you define them.)
    * String toString()
    * boolean equals(Object other)
    * int hashCode()
* Also nice
    * clone() - make a copy
    * compareTo(Thing other) - neg, zero, positive
