CSC207.01 2013F, Class 26: Implementing Lists with Arrays
=========================================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries.
    * Admin.
    * Exam questions.
* Status of our List Interface.
* Implementing Lists with Arrays - The Basics.
* Implementing Lists with Arrays - Some Complications.

_Admin_

* No readings for Tuesday.  Work on the exam!
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities
    * ???

_Exam Questions_

* There are now at least four writing corrections and two or three code
  corrections.  I've given you credit for both.
* How do arrays initialize?
    * Arrays of objects: null
    * Arrays of ints: 0
    * Arrays of Integers: probably null
* How do we compare arrays of strings?
    * Loops
    * Arrays of strings are arrays of objects.
    * Arrays.equals 
* How do we know if #5 works?
    * Provide your own comparator
* How can you have a class without a constructor?
    * If you don't specify a constructor, there's a default zero-parameter constructor
      that does nothing.

Sample comparator

    public class Alphabetic implements Comparator<String> {
         @Override
         public int compare(String s1, String 2) {
             return s1.compareTo(s2);
         } // compare
    // Alphabetic
