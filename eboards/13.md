_HW4_

How should we evaluate the following?

        r1 = 2/3
        1 + r1

You should give something like the following

        2/3, 5/3

What would you put in the Fraction class?  (We'll do this as a group.)

* Constructors
    * `Fraction(int,int)`
    * `Fraction(int)` - N/1
    * `Fraction(BigInteger,BigInteger)`
    * NOT `Fraction(Fraction)` - That's just cloning
    * `Fraction(BigInteger)`
    * `Fraction(String)` - `new Fraction("11/15")`
    * `Fraction(long,long)`
    * `Fraction(double)`
* Public methods
    * `Fraction add(Fraction other)`
    * `Fraction subtract(Fraction other)`
    * `Fraction multiply(Fraction other)`
    * `Fraction divide(Fraction other)`
    * `Fraction pow(int expt)`
    * `double doubleValue()`
    * `BigDouble bigDoubleValue()`
    * `Fraction reciprocal()`
    * `Fraction negate()`
    * `BigInteger numerator()`
    * `BigInteger denominator()`
    * `Fraction fractionalPart()`
    * `BigInteger wholePart()`
* Standard methods
    * `Fraction clone()`
    * `String toString()`
    * `int hashCode()`
    * `int compareTo(Fraction other)`
    * `boolean equals(Object other)`
* Private methods
    * `void simplify()`
    * `void cleanup()`
* Methods that we don't really want to implement and Sam won't expect us to implement
    * `Fraction pow(Fraction expt)`
    * `Fraction sqrt()`
    * `Fraction log()`
    * `BigInteger round()`
    * `BigInteger ceiling()`

Hash code implementation

    * `int hashCode() { return 1; }`
    * `int hashCode() { return numerator.hashCode() * denominator.hashCode(); }`

Why won't my test code work

        public void test() throws Exception {
            ...
        }

More on the text block example
------------------------------

* A line is a text block
* The vertical compositon of two text blocks is a text block
* A textblock that is boxed is a textblock
<pre>
    +-------+
    | Hello |
    +-------+
</pre>
* What are the important ideas in this example?
   * Recursive definitions of data types
   * Supported by polymorphism
   * Extensible!

Inheritance basics
------------------

* General concept: We can define new classes in terms of old
* Why not have the language do what we would do by hand
    Foo extends Bar
    * Implicitly copy all of the fields and methods of Bar into Foo
    * Foo can add new methods and fields
    * Foo can replace methods (but not fields)
* Supports polymorphism
* Lets Aristotilian philosophy add to Platonic philosophy

Lab
---

* Start it in class.
* We'll continue it on Monday.  People are having more difficulty than I expected.
* Sorry that I failed in being succinct.  I'll try again on Monday.

Sample code

    public class Counter {
       int count;
       int start;

       public Counter(int i) {
           this.count = i;
           this.start = i;
       } // Counter(int)

    } // class Counter
