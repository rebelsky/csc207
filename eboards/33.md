_Exam Makeup_

* Sorry that predicate code temporarily disappeared.

_HW8_

* Bring questions on Monday.

_Project_

* Choice 1: Everybody does the project
* Choice 2: Everybody does homework
* Choice 3: People can choose one or the other
* Choice 4: Do both

* Android didn't go well, and while I'd like to learn Android, it's not worth
  the stress, so I'd like the option of homework instead.
* Choice wins.
* Maybe Lea will develop a prototype that makes your life easier.
