### Questions

_What is the relationship of problem 1 to merge sort?_

> Merge sort says: 1. Split into two subarrays.  2. Sort the subarrays.  3.
Merge the sorted subarrays together.  You are thinking about step 3 only.

_How do I turn in an exam at 10 a.m. on Thursday?_

> Slide it under my door.

Lists
-----

Lab
---

* Try to get lists working using a simplified version of the process in the 
  reading.  (Don't worry about creating the info object; just create the array
  and adapter.)
* See if you can find a way to update lists (e.g., count button clicks somewhere
  and show those).

Debrief
-------

* Was it worth a week of your time to play with Android?
    * Nice to have a cool topic that doesn't count at the end of the semester.
* Should we do Android at the beginning of the semester and have each assignment 
  tie in an Android activity (e.g., come up with reasons you want to use certain 
  data structures with the list)?
    * No.
* Should we just do GUI programming on the computer instead?
    * Maybe.
